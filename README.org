#+TITLE: Kitchen Salt v2: Electric Boogaloo

This is a much simpler kitchen-salt provisioner, inspired by the
[[https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/salt-masterless.html][packer implementation]].

* Installation

Put these words in your Gemfile and run =bundle install=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  gem 'kitchen-salt', git: 'https://github.com/arecker/kitchen-salt.git'
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Configuring

These are the only options supported right now.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  provisioner:
    name: salt

    # Path to local state tree (including top.sls)
    local_state_tree: ./salt

    # Path to local pillar tree (including top.sls)
    local_pillar_roots: ./pillar

    # Path to minion config (you can put grains here too)
    minion_config: path/to/minion/config

    # Output of salt-call state.highstate
    state_output: mixed

    # state to run, otherwise defaults to state.highstate
    custom_state: state.highstate
#+END_SRC
