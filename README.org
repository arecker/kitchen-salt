#+TITLE: Kitchen Salt v2: Electric Boogaloo

This is a much simpler kitchen-salt provisioner.  The configuration is
inspired by the [[https://www.packer.io/docs/provisioners/salt-masterless.html][packer salt provisioner]].  Just specify the path to
your local salt tree and pillar tree and you are good to go!

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
  provisioner:
    name: salt
    local_state_tree: ./salt
    local_pillar_roots: ./pillar
    state_output: mixed
#+END_SRC
